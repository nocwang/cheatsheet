## Machine learning notebooks

This project contains solutions to the [Stanford Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
course exercises implemented with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). The scikit-learn 
machine learning library provides optimized implementations for all algorithms presented in the course and needed in 
the course exercises. Instead of writing low-level [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) code, as required by 
the course, the solutions presented here demonstrate how to use scikit-learn to solve these exercises on a much higher 
level. It is a level that is closer to that of real-world machine learning projects. This project respects the 
[Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) as the presented 
solutions can't be used to derive the lower-level Octave code that must be written to complete the assignments. 

I developed these solutions while learning Python and its 
[scientific programming libraries](https://www.scipy.org/) such as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), 
[SciPy](https://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and 
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) in a machine learning context. The solutions are provided as 
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Python notebooks. Developers new to scikit-learn hopefully find them useful to see how 
the machine learning topics covered in the course relate to the 
[scikit-learn API](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html). In their current state, the notebooks neither 
explain machine learning basics nor introduce the used libraries. For learning machine learning basics I highly 
recommend attending the course lectures. For an introduction to the used libraries the following tutorials are a good 
starting point: 

- [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [NumPy tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html)
- [SciPy tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html)
- [Pandas tutorial](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)
- [Pyplot tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html)
- [Scikit-learn tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html)
